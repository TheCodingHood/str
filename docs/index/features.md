- [x] strongly typed
- [x] no exceptions thrown
- [x] fast
- [x] new functions

A fast string manipulation library with multi-byte support. 
Inspired by the ["Stringy"](https://github.com/danielstjules/Stringy) library, with focus on speed.

Lib uses php7 features and does not throw any 
exceptions (because all input parameters are 
strongly typed). The code is completely covered by unit tests.
